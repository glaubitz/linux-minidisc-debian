.SH NAME
himdcli \- Command line interface for accessing HiMD Walkman
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B himdcli "\<HiMD path\>" "\<command\>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhimdcli\fP is a command line interface for accessing HiMD Walkman. It
uses the libhimd library to read and write audio tracks from a HiMD filesystem
which can be mounted directly from a physical HiMD Walkman or a previously
created image file of a HiMD. The mount point of the HiMD filesystem must
be provided as an argument to \fBhimdcli\fP together with the command to
be performed.

Currently libhimd and therefore \fBhimdcli\fP implements full read access
for PCM, ATRAC-3+ and MP3 tracks as well as experimental write support
for MP3 tracks (MP3 playback is supported by second and third generation
of HiMD Walkman only). Non-MP3 tracks are protected by Sony's DRM
software stack OpenMG, which require a sophisticated calculation of
keys and access control lists. Writing of non-MP3 tracks is therefore
currently not yet supported.

In addition to transfer capabilities, \fBhimdcli\fP provides some commands
for debugging purposes. These include \fBstrings\fP to display all strings
found in the track list file (TRKIDX##.HMA), \fBtracks\fP and \fBtracks
verbose\fP to display (detailed technical) track information, \fBdiscid\fP
to display the disc id (comparable to the filesystem ID of FAT formatted
volumes) which is used by the OpenMG encryption, \fBmp3key\fP to display
the MP3 encryption key for a given MP3 track on disc as well as \fBholes\fP
to display the holes in a non-contiguous ATDATA##.HMA file (a container
file where all tracks are stored on a HiMD filesystem).
